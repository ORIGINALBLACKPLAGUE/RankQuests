## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Supercomputer!
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When performing automated conversions with calculated angles under 10¬∞, the macro initiates at a 2.5¬∞ angle and increments as needed. However, there is an issue where 2.5¬∞ selections are occasionally misinterpreted as approximately 90¬∞, resulting in significantly more pets being converted than required.
